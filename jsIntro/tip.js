//Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

// 🔰 create variable for bill value
// 🔰 Create a variable called 'tip'. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. (💡 don't use else if, use ternary operator)
// 🔰 Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip)
//Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25”
