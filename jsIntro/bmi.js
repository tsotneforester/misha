// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index)
// BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
// Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

// ðŸ”° 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// ðŸ”° 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula
// ðŸ”° 3. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI (<value>) is higher than John's (<value>)!" or "John's BMI (<value>) is higher than Mark's (<value>)!"

//ðŸ’¡ Hint: Use an if/else statement and template literal
